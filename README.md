# Coursera_Capstone
This repository is a demostration of my final capstone project for IBM Big Data Analysis Coursera.

The Toronto python notebook showcases my work on how neighbourhoods of Toronto are indentified and clustered into groups.

The Move to Canada python notebook showcases my work on suggesting how similar the major 15 cities of Canada are. At the end, a new major city in foreign country is introduced and it will be used to find which group of cities are suitable for people of the foreign city to move to.
